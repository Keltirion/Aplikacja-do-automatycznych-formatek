            <li>Do you have offloading facilities (manhandling offload from a vehicle not allowed)?</li>

            Once above details has been confirmed our transport partners DSV will contact you approximately one week prior to delivery to arrange a specific delivery day. If you have not heard from DSV by {}, please contact our Logistics Department on 01869 353562 and state your above order number.<br><br>
            
            <b>As per the general condition of sale the goods will be off-loaded at the nearest accessible point to the delivery address at the discretion for the driver, which may be kerb-side. The driver will not handle the goods further.</b><br><br>
            
            <b>Storage Policy:</b> Providing we receive <b><u>1 week notice prior to the dispatch date</u></b>, we will store the windows without charge for a maximum duration of two weeks.  After this period, we can offer you storage at the price of Â£50.00 per pallet per week (one pallet = approximately 8 windows). Should storage be used, delivery will not be made until any outstanding costs are settled in full.<br><br>
            
            <b>Damage Policy:</b> From the date of delivery we remind you that there is a <b>7 day</b> notification period for  non-visible damages & <b>24 hrs</b> for visible damages to be notified. <b>Rectification or replacement of damaged goods notified outside this time will be charged plus appropriate delivery costs. </b><br><br>
            
            Please note the delivery driver must allow you a reasonable time to check the delivery and confirm it is in good order. Our transport partners allow a maximum of 30 mins for offloading and checking visible damage.<br><br>

            Whilst it is rare for goods to arrive with damage we can only consider a claim if the procedures set out are followed.<br><br>
            
            <b>Signing for goods without notifying visible damage will result in any subsequent claim being rejected.</b><br><br>
            
            <b>N.B: The above is subject to the payment terms previously agreed with VELFAC on this project - Your delivery date may change based on your payment status</b><br><br>
            
            Please be advised that if your account terms are payment prior to delivery you will already have received an invoice from our Credit Control team advising when the payment is due and our bank details are shown on the invoice<br><br>
